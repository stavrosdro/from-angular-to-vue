# from-angular-to-vue

This is an example app that is equivalent in Angular and Vue. I added a `docker-compose` file to start and make changes **only for dev/test purposes**. 

## Build the app:

```
docker-compose build
```

## Start the app

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop the app

```
docker-compose-down
```
